 -> For a more inclusive and accessible type scale, we use the browser’s default root font-size (typically 16px) so visitors can  customize their browser defaults as needed.
 -> Use the $font-family-base, $font-size-base, and $line-height-base attributes as our typographic base applied to the <body>.
 -> Set the global link color via $link-color.
 -> Use $body-bg to set a background-color on the <body> (#fff by default).
